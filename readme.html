        <h3>About SymbolicBot</h3>
        <p>
            SymbolicBot @2024, created by Neal Brandon Jr, showcases how symbolic, rule-based chatbot systems 
            can be developed without using NLP or machine learning. The chatbot pulls information from APIs 
            to generate conversational responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of SymbolicBot is to help others learn and develop their own symbolic chatbots while 
            demonstrating the limitations and possibilities of rule-based AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Symbolic AI can be integrated with NLP and machine learning to create hybrid systems, 
            leveraging the strengths of both approaches.
